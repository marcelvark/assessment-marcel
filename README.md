I developed this Angular project for a job assessment. Having no prior experience with Angular, SCSS, or RXJS, I used tutorials and online resources to complete it.

The objective was to demonstrate Angular skills by setting up a project, creating pages, implementing mock API calls using RXJS, and applying custom styling based on a simple design. I had to build a mockup with login- and dashboard pages, and to ensure the user's logged-in state persisted across page reloads. Server data samples were provided in JSON format.

To handle the login functionality, I created a Service and opted to store server data in sessionStorage. I used some RXJS there, but avoided more advanced implementations, as they felt out of place for the scope of this assessment.

Since using a UI component library wasn't required, I used SCSS for styling, drawing inspiration from the provided design examples. I also chose not to include icons. Adding comments was a part of the assignment. Templates are relatively straightforward, so I chose to mostly comment the CSS and login Service.

This project was generated using Angular CLI version 18.0.3.
